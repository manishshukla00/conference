          Human tendency has always remained dynamic and has led to various revolutions for mankind. Nineteenth century was the era of machine revolution, twentieth century was the era of electronic revolution but the 21st century is time of Intelligent Computing and Communication Technology (ICCT) revolution. The peculiar thing with ICCT revolution is that it is globalized while earlier revolutions belonged only to some countries. ICCT is touching each and every walk of life. Now every field of life such as industrial, rural development, medical, economical, even social field are looking forward for help from CIT for their survival and growth.

          ICCT in itself consists of wide range of possibilities which are increasing exponentially day by day. To cope up with increasing global need for high performance, more efficiency, and optimized output; advance computing technologies are the growing research area in the field of ICCT. Although various high performance models such as cluster computing, Grid computing and cloud computing have been proposed but these models are still looking for big hands in research. So, Intelligent Computing has been one of the most promising research areas throughout the globe for some decades now.
