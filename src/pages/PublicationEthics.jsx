              The International Conference on Smart Computing, Communication and
              Automation (ICSCCA) 2025 is dedicated to maintaining the highest
              standards of publication ethics and will stop publication
              malpractices at all costs. Among other things, the Editorial Board
              is in charge of stopping publication misconduct. Plagiarism in any
              form is not tolerated by the ICSCCA 2025, and unethical behavior
              is unacceptable. Authors who have contributed articles confirm
              that the content of the manuscript is original. Additionally, the
              submission by the authors indicates that the work has not been
              previously published in any language, in whole or in part, and
              that it is not presently being considered for publication anywhere
              else. According to the Code of Conduct for editors, authors, and
              reviewers within the ICSCCA 2025 are expected to uphold the
              highest standards of good publication practice and take full
              responsibility for carrying out their assigned tasks. The
              author(s) of an article surrenders copyright to Budge Budge
              Institute of Technology, India (BBIT) upon acceptance for
              publication; nevertheless, authors are still responsible for the
              content of their published works. As part of the ICSCCA 2025
